# react-viewer-viewer-api

This is a REST API for the [react-viewer-viewer](https://github.com/152334H/react-viewer-viewer) frontend, implemented in TypeScript, using Express.js and MongoDB.

The API was designed for personal use, and generally does not support multiple users, even if much of the scaffolding & code is easily adapted to such purposes.

## How to run
Read `docker-compose.yml` and replace undefined constants with deployment-specific values, then run

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```
